# Micro- A simple CSS grid system.

Micro has two purposes. Prototyping quickly and converting your prototype to releasable code. Using classes to set the grid and the responsive traits of your page is quick, but this produces hard to manage HTML and CSS in the long run. Quickly switch to releasable code by using mixins.

## Configuration

```sass
@import "micro";
@include micro(12, 5px);
```

### Prototype Mode
Prototype mode can be turned off once you are ready to stop prototyping. This means that the dozens of classes that are generated by Micro will not be generated and you can just use the mixins to implement your grid.

```sass
@import "micro";
@include micro(12, 5px, false);
```
The third parameter allows you to turn off the classes from Prototype Mode.

### Prefixes
Need to use two different grid systems on a single site? You might have good reasons.

```sass
@import "micro";
@include micro(12, 5px, false, "ms-");
```

The fourth parameter allows you to prefix the classes and Sass placeholders.

## Use It!

### Prototyping
Prototyping is quick and easy thanks to helpful classes for three breakpoints (small at >= 768, medium at >= 990, and large at >= 1200). Those column classes are available at `.columns-sm-*`, `.columns-md-*`, and `.columns-ld-*`. The column-offset classes are the same at `.column-offset-sm-*`, `.column-offset-md-*`, and `.column-offset-ld-*`.

```sass
@import "micro";
@include micro(12, 5px);
```

```html
<div class="container row">
	<nav class="columns-12 columns-md-4 columns-offset-md-1"></nav>
	<main class="columns-12 columns-md-7"></main>
</div>
```

### Releasable CSS
Once you have your breakpoints dialed in, you can quickly convert those to CSS.

```sass
@import "micro";
@include micro(12, 5px, false);

.container {
	@extend %row;
}
nav {
	@include micro-columns(12);
	@include micro-columns-query(4, md);
	@include micro-column-offset-query(1, md);
}
main {
	@include micro-columns(12);
	@include micro-columns-query(7, md);
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
	<nav></nav>
	<main></main>
</div>
```

### Using Micro Breakpoints for Your Styles
What if you need to change something other than the column count on a breakpoint? Microâ€™s got you covered!

```sass
@import "micro";
@include micro(12, 5px, false);

.container {
	@extend %row;
}
nav {
	@include micro-columns(12);
	
	@include micro-query(sm) {
		ul {
			text-align: center;
			
			li {
				display: inline-block;
			}
		}
	}
}

```
